# SAR-Optical Image Translation

This work conceptualizes a deep learning model - "S-(Pro)-CycleGAN". This model is a Supervised CycleGAN with a U-Net architecture using techniques like equalized learning rate and layer normalization introduced in the ProGAN paper to smoothen the training process, created in an attempt to build on the state-of-the-art of SAR-Optical Image Translation Models.

Kindly refer to the paper uploaded to understand the model proposed.
